//area of disk: will take the input given from the test code and use it in a function that will do pi * r^2, where pi
// is taken from math.h. this function will return the variable A which is the area of the disk.

//area of ring: will probably call on the area of the disk function twice taking the outer radius of the disk, finding 
the area and subtracting it from the area of the inner disk after using the radius to find it. then will return a
variable containing the area of the ring.

bigger minus smaller: will do simple comparator function using inputs (x,y) and determining if x > y, then
x = big number, else y = big number then setting the other variable to = small number.
 Also checking to see if they are the same by doing if x == y (or something along the lines.), then doing
big number - small number and returning that value

value in range: checks to see if given value is greater than/equal to lower bound and less than/equal to upper bound, if so return true, else return false.

sum of greater squares: will start by using nested if statements to see which number is smallest, then will square the second and first biggest numbers, add them together, and return that sum.

caat.c: follow what you did in class using getchar() and assigning it to a variable and determining if the character 
is aeiouAEIOU and if it is then printing the variable in which the getchar() is assigned to, if its not aeiouAEIOU then continuing until the next vowel or EOF.
